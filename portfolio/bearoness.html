			<h3>What Is It?</h3>
			<p>"Bearoness" is an isometric stealth game where the player controls
					a princess cursed to become a bear. In order to lift the curse, she has to 
					find true love by infiltrating a fancy castle ball
					and winning the prince's heart (while being a bear).

			<h3>What Is The Main Mechanic?</h3>
			<p>The bear has 2 control schemes for movement; either she can sacrifice stealth for speed by running on 4 legs, or she can wobble on 2 legs to avoid suspicion, because when she wears gown and walks 2 legs she obviously look human. However, with that wobbleness, she might bump into people 
					and objects, which also raise suspicion. When suspicion becomes too high, people realize she is a bear and flee, thereby not allowing her to reach the prince. However, she can find coat closets inside the castle, where she can change into a different dress, causing everyone to think there is once again no longer bears on the premise, allowing our heroine to continue her quest for love.

			<h3>How Was It Made?</h3>
			<p>
				The game is made in Unity over the course of 7 weeks by a team of 5 people. I worked as the team's producer and lead programmer. In my producer role, I assigned tasks to group members, kept our production schedule on track, and ensured positive group dynamic. As a programmer, I designed the software structure, implemented the bulk of the game mechanics, and imported assets into the engine.

			<h3>What Did I Learn?</h3>
			<p>This is my first 3D game, so I learned to integrate the pipeline between Unity and Maya. Next, being the main programmer made me pretty proficient at using Unity. Thirdly, I learned to manage a long-term production schedule for 5 people, which required me to make many adjustmentss to accomodate constant changes and emergencies, such as a group member breaking her leg during the final crunch week. Finally, I realized that I really had fun sitting around brainstorming crazy game ideas with my group.
